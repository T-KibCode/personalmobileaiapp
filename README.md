# Yugioh Deck Counter AI

## Project Overview

This repository hosts the code for an AI application designed to assist Yugioh Trading Card Game (TCG) players in countering the top competitive decks by analyzing tournament data and playing styles. The AI will recommend strategies and deck choices to counter the current top five decks, and it provides users with the ability to purchase suggested cards through affiliate links. The application is compatible with both Apple and Android devices in addition to the website.

## Features

- **Deck Analysis:** It analyzes the playing styles, strengths, and weaknesses of each competitive deck to recommend strategies.

- **Top Five Deck Recommendations:** Based on the selected target deck, the AI recommends the top five decks to counter its strengths and playstyle.

- **Card Purchase:** Users can purchase recommended cards through links to platforms such as Cardmarket, Amazon, or ygoprodeck, helping generate income through referral links.

- **Compatibility:** The application is compatible with Apple and Android devices, as well as web browsers.

- **Color Palette:** The color palette for the app and website will be generated using [Khroma](https://www.khroma.co/generator).
